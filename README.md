BLX — A lightweight collection of Webflow-friendly enhancements

BLX is a set of small, focused JavaScript packages designed to add useful behaviour to Webflow and similar no-code setups. Each package is self-contained, easy to integrate, and built with real-world Webflow constraints in mind.

The repository is structured so you can:

- load only the packages you use
- or load everything through a single global loader
- keep clean versioning through GitHub Releases + jsDelivr CDN
- scale the library as more packages are added

📚 At the moment, BLX includes: 
- TOC (Table of Contents) package
- Inline SVG package

💡 Roadmap
More packages will be introduced soon.
The structure is designed so each feature comes as a clean, independent module with:

- its own folder
- its own initialiser
- auto-detection through the global loader
